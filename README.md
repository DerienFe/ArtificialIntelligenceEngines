Computer code collated from various sources for use with the book: 
    
      Deep Learning Engines  
        by James V Stone

http://jim-stone.staff.shef.ac.uk/DeepLearning/DeepLearningMain.html

Note that the book is principally about the mathematics of deep learning.
This repository is intended to provide 'taster' code, rather than an exercise in how to program deep learning networks. Most of this code is in Python, with some code duplicated in MatLab.

All code in this repository has been reproduced with permission from the authors.
