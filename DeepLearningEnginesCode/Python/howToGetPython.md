=================

The simplest and most complete Python can be downloaded from Anaconda:
https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

To find out where the default version of python is stored, type this to unix shell:

$ which python3

/Users/JimStone/anaconda3/bin/python3

Or, to download the basic Python language go to:

https://www.python.org/

I use the IPython application called Spyder which can be launched from within Anaconda.

In order to use standard neural network packages, you need to install speciifc packages:

Saving Notebook as Python  Code
===========================

Sometimes an online example is presented as a Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
You can save the Python code to run within a Python application (e.g. Spyder).

From within Anaconda’s Jupyter Notebook, find the menu item;
	Download as …
or from Jupyter Lab, find the menu item
	Export Notebook as …
and download to file *.py.
