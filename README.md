# Artificial Intelligence Engines

NOTE: THIS IS A DRAFT.

Computer code collated from various sources for use with the book: 
    
**Artificial Intelligence Engines: **
**      A Tutorial Introduction to the Mathematics of Deep Learning**
  **      by James V Stone**

http://jim-stone.staff.shef.ac.uk/DeepLearning/DeepLearningMain.html

Note that the book is principally about the mathematics of deep learning.
This repository is intended to provide 'taster' code, rather than an exercise in how to program deep learning networks. Most of this code is in Python, with some code duplicated in MatLab. Because these examples are collated from different sources, the coding style varies between examples.

Each example has been reproduced with permission from the author.

Downloading Single Files
========================
Github normally insists you download the whole repository.
However, to download a single file
1) go to the file so you can see it in the github user interface 
2) click on the RAW button in the upper right
3) use the browser "save as ..." menu to save the file to your computer. 

How To ...
===========
There is help file within each directory, for example:

    DeepLearningEnginesCode/Python/howToGetPytorch.tex.md
